## 🧠 Problem Statement

> How can an E-commerce company use historical sales data to identify top-selling products, customer trends, and sales seasonality?

### Objectives:

* Understand revenue trends across time, products, and regions
* Analyze customer buying behavior and order frequency
* Identify key product categories and underperforming areas

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Size**: \~30,000+ orders
* **Features**: Order ID, Product, Category, Price, Quantity, Order Date, Customer ID, City, State, Payment Method

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**

  * `pandas` – data manipulation
  * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization
  * `numpy` – numerical operations
  * `datetime` – date processing
  * `plotly` (optional) – interactive charts
* **Jupyter Notebook** – project development

---

## 📊 Process

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Removed missing and duplicate records
* Converted date columns to `datetime`
* Created derived columns like `Order Month`, `Sales = Price × Quantity`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed:

  * Monthly revenue trends
  * Top-selling products and categories
  * Sales by city/state
  * Order frequency per customer
* Visualized trends with line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps

### 3. Advanced Insights

* Identified sales seasonality
* Analyzed product return rates (if available)
* Segmented customers based on order volume
