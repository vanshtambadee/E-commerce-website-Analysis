##  Problem Statement

> How can an E-commerce company use historical sales data to identify top-selling products, customer trends, and sales seasonality?

### Objectives:

* Understand revenue trends across time, products, and regions
* Analyze customer buying behavior and order frequency
* Identify key product categories and underperforming areas

---

## Dataset

* **Size**: \~30,000+ orders
* **Features**: Order ID, Product, Category, Price, Quantity, Order Date, Customer ID, City, State, Payment Method

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**

  * `pandas` – data manipulation
  * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization
  * `numpy` – numerical operations
  * `datetime` – date processing
  * `plotly` (optional) – interactive charts
* **Jupyter Notebook** – project development

---

## Process

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Removed missing and duplicate records
* Converted date columns to `datetime`
* Created derived columns like `Order Month`, `Sales = Price × Quantity`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed:

  * Monthly revenue trends
  * Top-selling products and categories
  * Sales by city/state
  * Order frequency per customer
* Visualized trends with line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps

### 3. Advanced Insights

* Identified sales seasonality
* Analyzed product return rates (if available)
* Segmented customers based on order volume

---

##  Key Insights

*  **Top Products:** Headphones, Smartwatches, and USB Cables dominated sales
* x **Highest Sales Month:** December due to holiday shopping
*  **Top Regions:** Mumbai and Bangalore accounted for 45%+ revenue
*  **Most Used Payment Method:** Credit Card


##  Results & Impact

* Delivered actionable business insights for product planning and regional marketing
* Helped identify top-selling SKUs and underperforming segments
* Built clear visualizations that enhance stakeholder presentations

---

##  Future Improvements

* Add customer lifetime value (CLV) and RFM analysis
* Deploy as a Streamlit or Flask dashboard
* Integrate data pipeline for automated analysis
